I"æ<p>A couple years ago, I came accross <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/43qv9c/lets_talk_wizard_money_a_look_through_everything/">this Reddit post</a>, and I thought ‚ÄúCor, that‚Äôs interesting!‚Äù.</p>

<p>Some months after that I was looking for a project to learn Laravel and thought that taking the estimates from that reddit post and making a little exchange calculator would be neat. I got down to business and finished the little web-app. It accepted an amount in GBP and it would show you the result in Galleons. Knuts and Sickles. It had a horrible interface, so I thought about making a pretty little webgl app with a goblin that takes your coins and then tells you the results. Unfortunately I suffer from a severe case of ‚ÄòEngineering‚Äô and are therefore crap at anything that has to do with design. I tried to create an interface and failed‚Ä¶ badly. So I left as it was to gather dust.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this year once again I thought about doing a little project. I decided to remake the currency exchange in golang instead of PHP and also have it connect to an actual currency exchange to facilitate more currencies.</p>

<p>For the interface I decided to hire the fabulous <a href="https://www.artstation.com/bubnelis">Gabrielus Bubnelis</a> to make me some art. I then created an interface in Unity WebGL, with a simpler interface for mobile(I‚Äôll add why in a future post).</p>

<p>Well, that is enough bollocks for now, here is <a href="https://wizarding.trade">wizarding.trade</a>. In the future I‚Äôll be doing a post about its development, lessons learned, mistakes and all that good stuff.</p>
